# SD_similaritymetrics
Contains code used to explore the usage of different similarity metrics for Scenario Discovery with Land Use Change Models

All files are spread over four folders according to their purpose. These are as follows:\
1. calculate - contains files used to compare maps using similarity metrics, both through Python alone and the Map Comparison Kit \
2. dependencies - contains files required by files in other folders, they generally provide access to functions so that the main notebooks remain clean
3. preparation - contains files that modify data sets for further processing
4. results - contains files that process the results from 'calculate' for clustering and CART analysis
