This folder contains files that are used for clustering and performing CART analysis. The general purpose of each file is as follows:

heatmap_qd_permutations.xlsx - Output file that contains the representative map comparisons for all map combinations and land-use categories \
results_CART.ipynb - Generates CART trees for all metrics \
results_CARTvars.ipynb - Dives deeper into variable usage in CART for different similarity metrics \
results_classes.ipynb - Visual comparison of categorical metrics \
results_cms.ipynb - Creates confusion matrices comparing cluster allocationg between all similarity metrics \
results_elbow.ipynb - Performs elbow method analysis for all metrics to find desired cluster numbers \
results_mediancms_cat.ipynb - Creates representative map comparisons per land-use cateogry \
results_mediancms_cbs.ipynb - Same as results_mediancms_pms but each representative map comparison is only shown once \
results_mediancms_pms.ipynb - Calculates quantity disagreement between all representative maps per similarity metric with repetition \
results_medianmaps.ipynb - Finds, for each metric's clusters, the map that is most similar to other maps in the cluster \
results_silhouette.ipynb - Performs silhouette analysis for all metrics to find desired cluster numbers \
